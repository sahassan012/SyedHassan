## Title: Publications Statistics

## Purpose: The purpose is to allow admin members to add, remove, and look at faculty data from different databases.

## Demo: https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/media/t/1_4e6m47uf

## Design: I used the 3 different database types (neo4j, mysql, and mongodb) to query the data required

## Implementation: I've used Python and the Dash libary.

## Contributions: I did not have a partner. I completed this on my own.
